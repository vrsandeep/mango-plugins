# Webtoons Plugin

This is the Mango plugin for [Webtoons](https://www.webtoons.com/en/).

Note that

- All downloaded chapters will be placed in their respective series folder in your library.
- Cloudflare rate limits extensive downloads. Adjust `wait_seconds` in `info.json` if you plan to download many chapters in one go (or chapters with many pages).
- For webtoons with a large number of chapters (200+), getting the chapter list takes marginally longer amount of time.
